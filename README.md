## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessor
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Throughout the project, I had to work with data being passed from component to component, and saving state. I learnt how to efficiently pass data from one component to another, and how to create UI that looks good not just in Desktop, but mobile UI as well


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Angular documentation helped me a lot when working with projects, and needed to know how a specific feature was used, and the best way to use it.
